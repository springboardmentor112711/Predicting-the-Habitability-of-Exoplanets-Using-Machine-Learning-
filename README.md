🌌 NASA Exoplanet Habitability Prediction System
🚀 Project Overview

The NASA Exoplanet Habitability Prediction System is a data-driven web application designed to analyze exoplanetary data and predict whether a planet has the potential to be habitable or non-habitable. This project bridges data science, machine learning, and web development, providing an end-to-end solution that transforms raw astronomical data into meaningful insights through prediction and visualization.

With the increasing discovery of exoplanets by space agencies, identifying potentially habitable planets has become a critical research area. This project aims to simplify that process by using historical planetary data and applying predictive modeling techniques to classify planets based on their habitability indicators.

The system is built with a Flask-based backend, a clean and responsive frontend using HTML and CSS, and an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore planetary features and predictions in a visually engaging way.

✨ Key Features

🔭 Habitability Prediction
Predicts whether an exoplanet is Habitable or Non-Habitable based on scientific parameters such as orbital period, planetary radius, mass, stellar flux, and temperature-related features.

📊 Interactive Dashboard
A user-friendly dashboard that visualizes important planetary attributes and prediction outcomes, making complex astronomical data easy to understand.

🌐 Web-Based Interface
Fully deployed and accessible through a web browser, enabling real-time interaction without the need for local setup.
