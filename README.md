# Habitability_of_Exoplanets

The discovery of exoplanets has accelerated in recent years, but identifying which planets could
potentially support life remains a challenge. Current astronomical methods are limited by observational
constraints, massive datasets, and complex planetary parameters.
This project, ExoHabitAI, aims to use machine learning to predict the habitability of exoplanets based on
physical, orbital, and stellar features. The system evaluates exoplanetary characteristics such as radius,
mass, orbital period, equilibrium temperature, and host star parameters to classify planets as potentially
habitable or not. By leveraging data-driven models, astronomers and researchers can prioritize
candidate exoplanets for further study, enhancing the efficiency of observational campaigns.
